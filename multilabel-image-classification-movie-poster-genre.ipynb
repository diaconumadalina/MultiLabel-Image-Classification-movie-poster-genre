The goal is to minimize the time spent on data loading and preparation so that the model spends more time learning from the data.\n\nKey aspects of a fast input pipeline include:\n\n1. **Parallelization:** Loading and preprocessing data in parallel to take advantage of multi-core processors or GPUs, reducing the overall time required for data preparation.\n\n2. **Batching:** Grouping the data into batches allows for more efficient processing, as operations can be parallelized across batches. It also helps to optimize memory usage.\n\n3. **Prefetching:** Overlapping the data loading and model training so that the next batch is ready for processing as soon as the current batch is completed. This helps to keep the hardware resources (CPU, GPU) busy and can lead to faster training times.\n\n4. **Data Augmentation:** Applying data augmentation techniques within the input pipeline to increase the diversity of the training data. This can improve the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data.\n\n5. **Optimized File Formats:** Choosing file formats that are optimized for fast reading, such as TFRecord files in TensorFlow or HDF5 files. This can significantly speed up the data loading process.\n\n6. **Shuffling:** Randomizing the order of the data to prevent the model from learning patterns based on the order of the training examples. Shuffling is commonly used during the training phase.\n\n7. **Memory Efficiency:** Optimizing memory usage, especially for large datasets. Techniques such as memory mapping or using generators can be employed to handle datasets that do not fit entirely in memory.\n\n8. **GPU Acceleration:** Offloading data loading operations to the GPU when possible, reducing the communication time between the CPU and GPU.\n\nA fast input pipeline is essential for achieving high training throughput, especially when dealing with large datasets and complex models.

These iterators are designed around a specific directory structure, where each subdirectory represents a distinct class.\n\n### Limitations in Multi-label Classification:\nHowever, when dealing with multi-label classification, this conventional directory structure becomes impractical. In multi-label scenarios, a single image may belong to multiple classes simultaneously, deviating from the one-subdirectory-per-class approach.\n\n### The Need for Custom Approaches:\nTraditional iterators may not suit these scenarios. Here's where approaches like the tf.data API come into play. This API provides advantages such as speed, precise control, and seamless integration with TensorFlow.\n\n### Leveraging tf.data for Multi-label Classification:\nInstead of relying on a fixed directory structure, custom functions can be implemented. These functions parse and preprocess image data, offering the flexibility required for multi-label classification tasks.\n\n### Key Aspects of the Custom Function:\n1. **Image Parsing and Feature Label Generation:**\n   The custom function parses image files and generates tensors for features and labels.\n\n2. **Handling Image Resizing and Normalization:**\n   This function manages tasks like resizing images to match the model's input expectations and normalizing pixel values to a range between 0 and 1.\n\n3. **Importance of Normalization:**\n   Normalizing pixel values is crucial for stabilizing the training process. It ensures that gradients remain within a manageable range, contributing to smoother and more effective model training.\n\n### The Power of tf.data API:\nIn summary, the tf.data API stands out due to its speed, fine-grained control, and seamless integration with TensorFlow. Customizing functions to parse and preprocess images transforms tf.data into a potent tool for multi-label classification.

Let's break down each component:\n\n1. **feature_extractor_layer**: This is the MobileNet V2 model loaded from TensorFlow Hub, serving as a feature extractor. It processes input images and outputs a fixed-size feature vector.\n\n    Yes, that's correct. The `feature_extractor_layer` in your model processes input images and outputs a fixed-size feature vector. Here's how it works:\n\n    1.1 **Input Images**: You provide input images to the model. These images should have the same dimensions as the expected input size for the MobileNet V2 model (224x224 pixels with 3 color channels - RGB).\n\n    1.2. **Feature Extraction**: The `feature_extractor_layer` (MobileNet V2) processes each input image through its layers. This process involves convolutions, pooling, and other operations that transform the input image into a higher-level representation, capturing important features.\n\n    1.3. **Fixed-Size Feature Vector**: The output of the `feature_extractor_layer` is a fixed-size feature vector. This vector contains information about the content of the input image in a condensed form. The fixed size is determined by the architecture of the MobileNet V2 model. In this case, it's a 1280-dimensional vector.\n\n    1.4. **Passing Features to the Rest of the Model**: This fixed-size feature vector is then passed to the subsequent layers of your model (dense layers in this case). These layers learn to map these features to the specific labels in your multi-label classification task.\n\nIn transfer learning, the idea is that the pre-trained MobileNet V2 model has already learned meaningful features from a large dataset (ImageNet in this case). By using it as a feature extractor, you leverage these learned features for your specific task, which can be especially beneficial when you have a limited amount of data for your specific problem. The subsequent layers of your model then adapt these features to make predictions on your multi-label classification task.\n\n<!-- 2. **layers.Dense(1024, activation='relu', name='hidden_layer')**: This is a dense (fully connected) layer with 1024 neurons. The activation function used is Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), which introduces non-linearity to the model. This layer is often referred to as a hidden layer because it's not part of the input or output layers. -->\n\n3. **layers.Dense(N_LABELS, activation='sigmoid', name='output')**: This is the output layer of the model. It has a number of neurons equal to the `N_LABELS` variable, which represents the number of labels in your multi-label classification task. The activation function used here is the sigmoid function. Since this is a multi-label classification problem, sigmoid activation is commonly used for each output neuron to produce a probability score between 0 and 1 for each label independently.\n\nThe sequential model (`tf.keras.Sequential`) is a linear stack of layers. The data flows sequentially from the first layer (feature_extractor_layer) through the hidden layer to the output layer. During training, the weights of all layers are adjusted to minimize the loss function and improve the model's ability to make accurate predictions on your specific multi-label classification task.\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<!-- code defines a TensorFlow Keras sequential model for a multi-label classification task using transfer learning with MobileNetV2\n\n```python\nmodel = tf.keras.Sequential([\n    feature_extractor_layer,\n    layers.Dense(1024, activation='relu', name='hidden_layer'),\n    layers.Dense(N_LABELS, activation='sigmoid', name='output')\n])\n```\n\n1. **`feature_extractor_layer`:**\n   - This is the MobileNetV2 feature extractor layer obtained from TensorFlow Hub.\n   - It processes input images and outputs a fixed-size feature vector.\n\n2. **`layers.Dense(1024, activation='relu', name='hidden_layer')`:**\n   - Adds a dense hidden layer with 1024 units (neurons).\n   - The activation function used is Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), which introduces non-linearity to the model.\n\n3. **`layers.Dense(N_LABELS, activation='sigmoid', name='output')`:**\n   - Adds the output layer with `N_LABELS` units.\n   - The activation function used is the sigmoid function.\n   - The sigmoid activation allows for binary classification for each label independently.\n   - In multi-label classification, where an example can belong to multiple classes, sigmoid is often used in the output layer.\n\nIn summary, the model architecture is as follows:\n- **Input:** Images are processed by the MobileNetV2 feature extractor.\n- **Intermediate Layer:** A dense hidden layer with 1024 units and ReLU activation.\n- **Output Layer:** A dense output layer with `N_LABELS` units and sigmoid activation for binary classification.\n\nThe reason for using MobileNetV2 as a feature extractor is transfer learning. MobileNetV2 has been pre-trained on a large dataset (ImageNet) and has learned useful hierarchical features. By using this pre-trained feature extractor, the model can benefit from these learned features and adapt to the specific task of classifying movie genres based on posters.\n\nDuring training, the weights of the feature extractor layer are frozen, and only the weights of the dense hidden and output layers are updated. This helps in utilizing the pre-trained knowledge for feature extraction while fine-tuning the model for the specific classification task.\n\nThe model is then compiled, and it can be trained on a dataset using a suitable optimizer, loss function, and evaluation metric. The sigmoid activation in the output layer allows for predicting multiple labels for each input image. The training process involves adjusting the model's weights to minimize the specified loss function, making it effective for the given multi-label classification problem. -->","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n\nIn summary, this model architecture leverages transfer learning by using a pre-trained MobileNet V2 model as a feature extractor and adds custom layers on top for adapting to your specific classification problem.

This feature vector captures higher-level patterns and information from the images. The MobileNet V2 model, having been pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, has learned to recognize general visual features.\n\nHere's how the process generally works in your multi-label classification model:\n\n1. **Loading Pre-trained Model**: You load the pre-trained MobileNet V2 model from the specified URL using TensorFlow Hub.\n\n2. **Feature Extraction**: When you pass an image through this MobileNet V2 model (as a `hub.KerasLayer` in your model), it extracts features from the image and outputs a fixed-size feature vector. This vector is a compact representation of the essential information in the image.\n\n3. **Additional Layers**: You append additional layers on top of the MobileNet V2 model to form your complete model. These additional layers can include dense layers that learn to classify the features extracted by MobileNet V2.\n\n4. **Training**: During the training phase, the weights of the new layers you added are updated based on your dataset. The weights of the pre-trained MobileNet V2 layers remain frozen; only the weights of the newly added layers are trained.\n\n5. **Prediction**: In the prediction phase, when you provide new images to your model, it uses the learned features to make predictions for each label. The final layer may use activation functions like sigmoid to output probabilities for each label independently.\n\nIn essence, the MobileNet V2 model acts as a powerful feature extractor that enables your model to recognize important patterns in your specific dataset without starting the learning process from scratch. The added layers specialize in classifying these features for your multi-label classification task.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 5. Model training and evaluation","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n**Loss Function:**\nIn the context of training a neural network for multi-label classification, the loss function is like a guide that helps the model adjust its internal parameters (weights) during training. The goal is to minimize this loss.\nIn this case, we need a loss function that can measure how far off our model's predictions are from the actual labels in the training data. This function must be differentiable, meaning we can calculate its gradient and use it to update the model weights through backpropagation.\n\n**Evaluation Function:**\nWhile the loss function guides the training process, the evaluation function gives us a clear understanding of how well our model is expected to perform in real-world scenarios. In this notebook, the F1-score is chosen as the evaluation metric.\nF1-score is a metric that combines two important aspects of a model's performance: precision and recall. Precision is about how many of the predicted positive instances are actually positive, while recall is about how many of the actual positive instances were correctly predicted.\nF1-score, being the harmonic mean of precision and recall, provides a balanced measure of a model's ability to make accurate positive predictions while not missing too many positive instances.\n\nThe precision and recall values are calculated using the concepts of True Positives (TP), False Positives (FP), and False Negatives (FN) from a confusion matrix.\nTP represents correctly predicted positive instances, FP represents instances predicted as positive but are actually negative, and FN represents instances predicted as negative but are actually positive.\n\nSo, in summary, the loss function guides the training process by quantifying the model's prediction errors, and the evaluation function (F1-score) gives us a holistic view of the model's performance based on precision and recall, considering the

It is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, calculated across all classes, and then averaged. The formula for macro F1-score is as follows:\n\n![image.png](attachment:21740f70-2e81-4b83-82bb-eed51ed9bcaf.png)\n\n\nIn TensorFlow/Keras, a custom metric function for macro F1-score might look something like this:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ndef macro_f1(y_true, y_pred):\n    # Assuming y_true and y_pred are one-hot encoded\n    true_positives = tf.reduce_sum(tf.cast(tf.math.logical_and(tf.equal(y_true, 1), tf.equal(tf.round(y_pred), 1)), dtype=tf.float32), axis=0)\n    false_positives = tf.reduce_sum(tf.cast(tf.math.logical_and(tf.equal(y_true, 0), tf.equal(tf.round(y_pred), 1)), dtype=tf.float32), axis=0)\n    false_negatives = tf.reduce_sum(tf.cast(tf.math.logical_and(tf.equal(y_true, 1), tf.equal(tf.round(y_pred), 0)), dtype=tf.float32), axis=0)\n\n    precision = true_positives / (true_positives + false_positives + tf.keras.backend.epsilon())\n    recall = true_positives / (true_positives + false_negatives + tf.keras.backend.epsilon())\n\n    f1 = 2 * precision * recall / (precision + recall + tf.keras.backend.epsilon())\n\n    macro_f1 = tf.reduce_mean(f1)\n\n    return macro_f1\n```\n\nThis function calculates the macro F1-score for a batch of predictions and true labels. It's important to note that this implementation assumes binary classification for simplicity, and you may need to adapt it for multi-class scenarios. If your problem involves multiple classes, you would need to extend this metric accordingly.\n\n* Model Architecture:\n\n    * model_bce is a Sequential model that consists of a feature extractor layer   (feature_extractor_layer) followed by a dense layer with a sigmoid activation function. This  architecture is commonly used for binary classification problems.\n\n* Compilation:\n\n    * The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer with a specified learning rate (5e-4), binary crossentropy as the loss function (indicating a binary classification task), and a custom metric macro_f1 is added to the list of metrics to monitor during training.\n\n* **macro_f1** metric:\n\n    * It takes y_true (true labels) and y_pred (predicted probabilities) as inputs.\n    * It calculates true positives, predicted positives, and actual positives for each class.\n    * Precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated for each class.\n    * Finally, it takes the mean across all classes to get the macro F1-score.\n\n    This metric is designed for binary classification tasks, and if your problem involves multiple classes, you would need to adapt it accordingly. Also, note that tf.keras.backend.epsilon() is added to avoid division by zero.\n    \n### 2. **Binary Cross-Entropy Loss**,\n\noften known as Binary Crossentropy, is a commonly used loss function in binary classification tasks. It is suitable for scenarios where each observation can belong to only one of two classes (0 or 1). This loss function quantifies the disparity between the true labels and the predicted probabilities for each observation.\n\nThe formula for Binary Cross-Entropy Loss is expressed as follows:\n\n\"L(y, ŷ) = - (1/N) * Σ [yᵢ * log(ŷᵢ) + (1 - yᵢ) * log(1 - ŷᵢ)]\"\n\nHere:\n- N represents the number of observations in the dataset.\n- yᵢ denotes the true label for the ith observation (either 0 or 1).\n- ŷᵢ is the predicted probability that the ith observation belongs to class 1.\n\nIn TensorFlow/Keras, you can utilize `tf.keras.losses.BinaryCrossentropy` to implement Binary Cross-Entropy Loss. Below is an example of how it is typically used in a model:\n\n```python\nmodel.compile(\n    optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=5e-4),\n    loss=tf.keras.losses.BinaryCrossentropy(),\n    metrics=[macro_f1]\n)\n```\n\nIn this code snippet:\n- `tf.keras.optimizers.Adam` is employed as the optimizer with a specified learning rate.\n- `tf.keras.losses.BinaryCrossentropy()` is designated as the loss function, indicating binary classification.\n- A custom metric, `macro_f1`, is appended to the list of metrics for monitoring during training.\n\nThe objective during training is to minimize this Binary Cross-Entropy Loss, aiming to make the predicted probabilities as close as possible to the true labels. The Adam optimizer is utilized to adjust the model's weights based on the gradients of the loss concerning the weights.\n\n### 3. **tf.keras.optimizers.Adam**:\n\n```python\noptimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=5e-4)\n```\n\n`tf.keras.optimizers.Adam` is an instance of the Adam optimizer, which is a popular optimization algorithm used in training neural networks. The Adam optimizer is an extension of the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm that incorporates adaptive learning rates and momentum.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the components in this line of code:\n\n- `tf.keras.optimizers.Adam`: This is the Adam optimizer class provided by the TensorFlow Keras API. It's an optimization algorithm that adapts the learning rates for each parameter during training.\n\n- `learning_rate=5e-4`: This is a hyperparameter specifying the learning rate for the optimizer. The learning rate controls the step size taken during optimization. A smaller learning rate often leads to slower but more stable convergence, while a larger learning rate may result in faster convergence but with the risk of overshooting the optimal weights.\n\nIn summary, the line of code initializes an Adam optimizer with a specified learning rate of `5e-4` (which is equivalent to `0.0005`).

How the model works","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n1. **Image Parsing Function (`parse_function`):**\n   - This function takes a filename and a label as input.\n   - It reads the image from the file using TensorFlow's `tf.io.read_file` function.\n   - The image is then decoded using `tf.image.decode_jpeg` with the specified number of channels (`CHANNELS`).\n   - The decoded image is resized to the specified dimensions (`IMG_SIZE`).\n   - The image is normalized by dividing pixel values by 255 to bring them into the range [0, 1].\n   - The function returns a tuple containing the normalized image array and the labels array.\n\n2. **Dataset Abstraction:**\n   - `BATCH_SIZE` is set to 256, which means the model will be trained on batches of 256 images at a time.\n   - `AUTOTUNE` is used for dynamic adjustment of preprocessing and prefetching workload.\n   - `SHUFFLE_BUFFER_SIZE` is set to 1024, meaning the training dataset will be shuffled in chunks of 1024 observations.\n\n3. **Dataset Creation Function (`create_dataset`):**\n   - This function takes a list of filenames, labels, and a boolean indicating whether it's in training mode.\n   - It creates a TensorFlow dataset from the filenames and labels.\n   - The `parse_function` is applied to each element of the dataset in parallel using `map` with a specified number of parallel calls.\n   - If in training mode, the dataset is cached and shuffled.\n   - The data is batched into batches of size `BATCH_SIZE`.\n   - Prefetching is applied to fetch batches in the background while the model is training.\n   - The function returns the final dataset.\n\n4. **Dataset Creation for Training and Validation (`train_ds` and `val_ds`):**\n   - These datasets are created using the `create_dataset` function with training and validation data.\n\n5. **Feature Extractor:**\n   - The feature extractor is a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model loaded from TensorFlow Hub (`feature_extractor_url`).\n   - The `feature_extractor_layer` is a Keras layer created from the URL with the specified input shape.\n\n6. **Freezing Feature Extractor:**\n   - The variables in the feature extractor layer are frozen (`feature_extractor_layer.trainable = False`) to prevent them from being modified during training. This is common in transfer learning scenarios.\n\n7. **Model Architecture:**\n   - The model is a sequential model.\n   - It starts with the frozen feature extractor layer.\n   - Followed by a dense layer with the number of units equal to the number of labels (`N_LABELS`), and the activation function is sigmoid.\n   - The model is compiled using binary crossentropy as the loss function and Adam optimizer with a small learning rate (`LR`).\n\n8. **Training the Model:**\n   - The model is trained using the `fit` method on the training dataset (`train_ds`).\n   - The training is performed for a specified number of epochs (`EPOCHS`).\n   - Validation data is provided using the validation dataset created with the `create_dataset` function for validation data (`X_val`, `y_val_bin`).\n\nThe model learns to predict labels by adjusting the weights of its trainable parameters during training. The training process involves forward and backward passes through the neural network, adjusting the model's parameters to minimize the defined loss function. The training data, consisting of images and corresponding labels, is used for this purpose.

However, the absolute scale of F1-score depends on the nature of the problem, and what is considered \"good\" can vary.\n\n### Considerations:\n\n- **Overfitting:**\n  - The slight difference in performance between the training and validation sets suggests that the model may be overfitting the training data.\n\n- **Model Evaluation:**\n  - While F1-score is important, you might also want to consider other metrics, especially if the problem has class imbalances. Precision, recall, and confusion matrices can provide additional insights.\n\n- **Model Complexity:**\n  - Evaluate the complexity of the model. If it's too complex, it might be fitting noise in the training data.\n\n- **Hyperparameter Tuning:**\n  - Experiment with hyperparameters, such as learning rate or regularization, to see if they impact the model's performance.\n\n- **Data Augmentation:**\n  - If not already done, consider applying data augmentation during training to increase the diversity of the training data.\n\nIt's an iterative process of experimenting with different aspects and closely monitoring the impact on both training and validation performance.

The probability distribution of the model's output exhibits Gaussian properties, with bell-shaped histograms. This indicates that the optimization process captures the original distribution of the data, as exemplified by the centering of the 'Drama' label probability distribution around 0.5, which corresponds to the label's prevalence in the dataset (50%).\n\nHowever, the classifier for 'Drama' seems weak, as there is considerable overlap in probability values between the two classes. Additionally, the model tends to assign lower probability scores to less frequent labels, such as 'Crime' (covering only 14% of the dataset), suggesting that the model learns from the rarity of these labels to predict lower probabilities.\n\nTo optimize the model trained with binary cross-entropy loss, one would typically:\n\nA. Explore different decision thresholds to find the optimal value that maximizes performance on a validation set. The F1-score, being threshold-dependent, can be improved by selecting a threshold that balances precision and recall effectively.\n\nB.

looks like you've defined a couple of functions for image preprocessing and making predictions using optimal thresholds. These functions seem suitable for a multi-label image classification task. Here's a breakdown of the functions:\n\n1. **preprocess_image**: This function takes an image path as input, loads the image, resizes it to the specified target size (IMG_SIZE x IMG_SIZE), converts it to a NumPy array, normalizes pixel values to the range [0, 1], and adds an extra dimension to make it suitable for input to a neural network.\n\n2. **predict_optimal_thresholds**: This function takes a pre-trained model, an image path, and optimal thresholds as input. It preprocesses the image using the `preprocess_image` function, then makes predictions using the model. The predictions are then thresholded using the provided optimal thresholds, converting them to binary values (0 or 1).\n\nTo use these functions, you would provide the path to an image and call `predict_optimal_thresholds` with your pre-trained model and optimal thresholds. The result will be binary predictions for each label based on the specified thresholds.\n\nIf you have any specific questions or if you'd like to see an example of how to use these functions, feel free to ask!","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\n\n# Specify file paths for loading the arrays\nload_path_optimal = '/kaggle/working/y_pred_optimal.npy'\nload_path_05 = '/kaggle/working/y_pred_05.npy'\n\n# Load the arrays from files\nloaded_y_pred_optimal = np.load(load_path_optimal)\nloaded_y_pred_05 = np.load(load_path_05)\n\n# Now, you can use the loaded arrays as needed\nprint(f'Loaded y_pred_optimal shape: {loaded_y_pred_optimal.shape}')\nprint(f'Loaded y_pred_05 shape: {loaded_y_pred_05.shape}')\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-12-08T15:19:03.466203Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-12-08T15:19:03.466777Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-12-08T15:19:03.477649Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-12-08T15:19:03.46674Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-12-08T15:19:03.47624Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 7.

Neural networks, however, excel in handling numerous classification problems simultaneously within one model. Mini-batch learning helps manage memory efficiently during training.\n\n2. **TensorFlow Data API (tf.data):**\n   - TensorFlow's tf.data is vital for creating efficient input pipelines. It represents observations as pairs of tensors, including images and labels. This abstraction allows easy parallel processing, shuffling, and batching.\n\n3. **Transfer Learning with TensorFlow Hub:**\n   - TensorFlow Hub simplifies transfer learning. You can load pre-trained models, like MobileNet, as feature extractors. During training, only the weights of added classification layers are updated, keeping the pre-trained model frozen.\n\nIn essence, this approach combines the power of neural networks, efficient data handling with tf.data, and transfer learning via TensorFlow Hub. The focus on optimizing directly for the macro F1 score simplifies training, especially in multi-label scenarios with numerous labels.\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### How the prediction process works?","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The process of predicting multiple labels for an image involves using a multi-label classification model. In the provided information, the model architecture includes a dense layer with the number of units equal to the number of labels (N_LABELS), and the activation function is sigmoid.\n\nHere's how the prediction process works:\n\n1. **Feature Extraction:**\n   - The image is passed through a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model loaded from TensorFlow Hub, serving as a feature extractor. This layer extracts high-level features from the input image.\n\n2. **Dense Layer with Sigmoid Activation:**\n   - The output from the feature extractor is then passed through a dense layer with a sigmoid activation function.\n   - The sigmoid activation function outputs values between 0 and 1 for each unit in the layer.\n   - In multi-label classification, each unit in the dense layer corresponds to a specific label, and the output value represents the confidence or probability that the image belongs to that label.\n\n3. **Prediction for Multiple Labels:**\n   - The output of the sigmoid activation for each unit in the dense layer can be considered as the probability that the corresponding label is present in the image.\n   - The model predicts multiple labels by thresholding these probabilities. For example, if the output for a particular label is above a certain threshold (e.g., 0.5), it is considered as predicted.\n\n4. **Training for Multi-Label Classification:**\n   - During training, the model is provided with training images and their corresponding labels.\n   - The binary crossentropy loss function is used, which is suitable for binary classification problems, and in this case, it's applied independently for each label.\n   - The model adjusts its weights to minimize the loss, learning to predict the presence or absence of each label in the training images.\n\n5. **Evaluation:**\n   - After training, the model can be evaluated on a separate validation dataset to assess its performance in predicting multiple labels for new, unseen images.\n\nIn summary, the model is designed to predict the presence or absence of each label independently, allowing it to handle multi-label classification tasks. The sigmoid activation function and binary crossentropy loss are key components that enable the model to make multiple, independent predictions for each label.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Sources:\n\n\n* https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/transfer_learning\n* https://github.com/berkayalan/neural-networks-and-deep-learning/blob/master/Transfer_learning_with_MobileNet_v1.ipynb\n* https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/07/demystifying-the-difference-between-multi-class-and-multi-label-classification-problem-statements-in-deep-learning/\n* https://keras.io/api/applications/mobilenet/\n* https://github.com/ashrefm\n* https://blog.research.google/2018/04/mobilenetv2-next-generation-of-on.html#:~:text=MobileNetV2%20is%20a%20significant%20improvement,object%20detection%20and%20semantic%20segmentation.\n\nMulti Label Model Evaluation\n\n* https://www.kaggle.com/code/kmkarakaya/multi-label-model-evaluation\n* https://towardsdatascience.com/evaluating-multi-label-classifiers-a31be83da6ea\n* https://medium.com/@evertongomede/multi-label-classification-in-python-empowering-machine-learning-with-versatility-9dbae34aacdb\n* https://machinelearningmastery.com/multi-label-classification-with-deep-learning/\n* https://jmread.github.io/talks/Tutorial-MLC-Porto.pdf\n* https://towardsdatascience.com/a-look-at-precision-recall-and-f1-score-36b5fd0dd3ec\n* https://ploomber.io/blog/threshold/\n\n\n* https://www.evidentlyai.com/classification-metrics/multi-class-metrics","metadata":{}}]}
